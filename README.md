A free Kotlin android app to manage books.
This is my final project for two of my Bachelor's degree courses (_Programmazione 3_ and _Sistemi aperti e distribuiti_).

## What you can do with Librery:
- Advanced search in Google books (Google account not required)
- Save book data locally
- Add notes and rating to each book in your library
- Share your thoughts about books you're reading with other users (in a very basic way)
- Run, study, share and redistribute the code... cause it's free software!

## Documentation
This project is somewhat documented, but at the moment the documentation is not exhaustive and in Italian, as it was written in order to pass the _Sistemi aperti e distribuiti_ course in my local uni and just focuses on the networking aspects. Still, you can download in pdf format since release 2.0.
